<h1>Rats</h1> 
<h2>Alan R. Turner</h2>

<p>
I hate these <small>rats</small>.<br>
I hate them with all my might.<br>
How do they get inside? <br>
I thought this place was tight.
</p>
<p>
They run so fast.<br>
They <i>scurry</i> and <i>chew</i> and <i>gnaw</i>.<br>
Small charge in the revolver,<br>
They're gone 'fore I can draw.<!--Yeehaw!--> 
</p>
<p>
They're <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwWACB6w8D0">smart</a>, these <small>rats</small>.<br>
They stay away from the bait.<br>
The dogs can never catch them.<br>
They're just a second late.<br>
</p>
<p>
Cold brings them in.<br>
Cold weather every fall.<br>
Summer they stay outside.<br>
Cold and they breach the wall.
</p>
<p>
Sorry little <small>rat</small>.<br>
Sorry, but you must go.<br>
There's not room for you in here.<br>
Sorry, but <del>you</del> must go. <!--this is the rat's house now my dude, get a new one-->
